description: |
    The Storage Connector charm is an open-source charm that can be installed as a
    subordinate to any VM or baremetal machine. It has two modes: iSCSI or Fibre Channel.
    In the iSCSI mode, it will connect the host to an iSCSI target and configure multipath 
    accordingly. For Fibre Channel, this charm detects the WWID of the FC LUNs and 
    configures multipath accordingly for the device to be ready to be used.
