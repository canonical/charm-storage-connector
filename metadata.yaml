    The Storage Connector charm is an open-source charm that can be installed as a
    subordinate to any VM or bare metal machine. It has two modes: iSCSI or Fibre Channel.
    In the iSCSI mode, it will connect the host to an iSCSI target and configure multipath
    accordingly. For Fibre Channel, this charm detects the WWID of the FC LUNs and
    configures multipathd so that the device is ready to be used.
